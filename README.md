# Živý obraz - firmware

Welcome to the Živý obraz repository with firmware for e-Paper development boards based on ESP32/ESP32-S3. Live Image is used to feed ePaper/e-Ink displays with image data from a web server, whether it is a bitmap or a custom basic RLE format called Z1/Z2/Z3.

  * Basic information can be found on the project website: https://zivyobraz.eu/ (Czech)
  * Specific information regarding getting things work can be found in the documentation at: https://wiki.zivyobraz.eu/ (Czech)
  * Firmware supports many boards, you can find specific hardware for Živý obraz to buy at [LáskaKit](https://www.laskakit.cz/vyhledavani/?string=%C5%BEiv%C3%BD+obraz) and [Pájeníčko](https://pajenicko.cz/vyhledavani?search=%C5%BEiv%C3%BD%20obraz).

**The documentation also includes precompiled firmware for flashing several of the most common types of ePapers, or you can use the web installer in Edge/Chrome browsers at: https://zivyobraz.eu/?page=instalace**
**The default password for the Wi-Fi that the board transmits after uploading the firmware is: _zivyobraz_**

In brief, about custom compilation and settings in the firmware code:

You will need to have the following libraries installed:
> zinggjm/GxEPD2@^1.6.0  
> adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.11.9  
>	adafruit/Adafruit SHT4x Library@^1.0.3  
>	adafruit/Adafruit BME280 Library@^2.2.4  
>	sparkfun/SparkFun SCD4x Arduino Library@^1.1.2

In code _**main.cpp**_ do not forget to uncomment:
1. Type of board used (ESPink_V2, ES3ink, ...)
2. If you plan to connect one of the supported sensors via uŠup for reading temperature, humidity, and pressure/CO2 and sending the values to the server, uncomment:
> //#define SENSOR
3. Display type. In the case of GRAYSCALE, you must remove "zinggjm/GxEPD2" from platformio.ini (just comment it out), otherwise there will be a library collision and the code will not work. In that case, "lib/GxEPD2_4G" will be used. For other displays (BW, 3C, 7C), leave zinggjm/GxEPD2 active; you don't need to do anything with the 4G version.
> #define TYPE_BW // black and white  
> //#define TYPE_3C // 3 colors - black, white and red/yellow  
> //#define TYPE_GRAYSCALE // grayscale - 4 colors  
> //#define TYPE_7C // 7 colors
4. Uncomment the definition of the specific ePaper you are putting into operation. This section begins at line 86, and you need to select a specific display, e.g.:
> // BW  
> //#define D_GDEY0213B7    // 122x250, 2.13"  
> //#define D_GDEW042T2     // 400x300, 4.2"  
> #define D_GDEW075T7     // 800x480, 7.5"  

After successfully compiling and flashing the board, continue with the documentation "Bringing your own ePaper to life":
